# projects-and-practice
- projects that I made that have a lack of importance but are a show of my progress over time.
  
---

# - scripts 
- login.py, a login script that stores user data and receive user input, asks a few questions.
- failed_login.py a failed version of the first script that tried to use ValueError, etc.

---

# - the repository will be updated
- - The idea is to:
    - Add new files to the repository with new projects.
    - Improve projects that already exists, and making more complex scripts over time.
    - Register my advances and learning.
---
 - - - - This repository is meant to be a semi-portfolio of my learnings.
